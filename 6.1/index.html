                <p>My Love‚ù§Ô∏è My Jana üòò,</p>
                <p>
                    [Hey my love, Aditi, I know humare beech ka distance hume alag karta hai, but trust me, it can never separate our hearts. We are connected, and our souls are always together.

Whenever you feel sad or alone, just close your eyes and feel my presence. I will always be there for you, no matter what.

Our love is like a strong thread that binds us together. No matter how far we are, our love will only get stronger with each passing day.

I miss you more than words can say. But I am also happy because I know that one day, we will be together again, and our love story will be complete.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until then, let's keep the flame of our love burning. Let's make every moment count and create memories that we will cherish forever.<br>

You are my moon, and I am your star. Together, we will light up the darkest nights and make our world a beautiful place.

I love you, my life. Stay strong, and never give up on us. We will make it through this, and our love will be a testament to our strength and commitment.<br>
Distance means so little when someone means so much. These past six months have been proof of that. Thank you for everything.
                </p>
